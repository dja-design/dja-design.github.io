            <p class="page-text flex-item-50"> Loiza is a town is on the north shore of Puerto Rico, originally settled by Yoruban people brought there by the Spanish. Today Loiza is only 30 minutes away from San Juan by car, but was only accessible by ferry until 1970. Since they were cut off, the people of Loiza have managed to preserve their African heritage though a guerrilla system of subtitle references to their traditions, but the community remains one of the most impoverished on the island.<br><br>  Located in a mangrove forest across the river from the town, this library, education center, & exhibition space <span class="paragraph-highlight">seeks to covertly embody aspects of Loiza's heritage while specifically reacting to forces of the water and boundary unique to this site.</span></p>

                <p class="page-text flex-item-auto">This proposal is inspired by a traditional Yoruban house, which has individual rooms branching off a central courtyard. As families expand, Yorubans add additional courtyards branching off the main one.<br><br>
                The center features two similarly sized volumes for students and the public, the two primary groups of building users. The two volumes are first separated to create a gathering space. In response to the changing water line and levels, different parts of the building are pushed and pulled in both plan and section, as if by the force of the water, opening up the volumes to nature to emphasize the center's connection to the site. The two-tiered roof of a Puerto Rican kiosko provides ventilation and shade while enclosing the central space in each volume.</p>

A library serves as a hub for the classrooms, a central space for students to come together, discuss & learn.</p>
                <p class="page-text flex-item-auto">Oriented back to the park to visually connect the project to the town, the public wing houses flexible exhibition space and an amphitheater to showcase the community's culture, traditions, and local talent. The smaller volume pulled into the river can serve as a dock to connect the project to the town via ferry.</p>
