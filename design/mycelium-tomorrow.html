                <p class="page-text"> Like many dis-invested post-industrial cities in the US, Syracuse, New York faces the challenge of aging housing stock. Eighty-two percent of Syracuse's buildings were built before 1950, and have little to no thermal insulation, poor air sealing, and potentially hazardous materials, leading to uncomfortable living conditions, high energy bills, & increased operational carbon. While retrofitting existing homes with high-performance facades is a promising strategy, conventional practices involve petroleum-based materials with complex supply chains and a cradle-to-grave life cycle; <span class="paragraph-highlight">Mycelium, Tomorrow argues bio-materials can be a viable alternative; this research explores how mycelium composite materials can improve aging, energy inefficient homes in Syracuse through sustainable, affordable retrofits grounded in material research.</span> <br><br>
                Mycelium -the root structure of a mushroom- grows on substrates of organic matter; microscopic filaments called hyphae bind this matter into a lightweight, rigid material. By changing the composition, <span class="paragraph-highlight">one can tailor the material's properties toward specific performance goals,</span> reducing density for high-preforming insulation or maximizing durability & waterproofing for cladding.</p>

                <p class="page-text flex-item-auto">This project proposes <span class="paragraph-highlight">a series of grow hubs inhabiting vacant buildings in Syracuse which become engines of a new local material & knowledge economy.</span> These grow hubs source substrates and mushroom strains from within New York State's existing material economies, transforming sawdust and agricultural waste into biodegradable building insulation and finishing systems. At the end of a module's useful life, it can be returned to the ground, enriching the soil.</p>
